# Insert on a new line in this file the SHA-1 hash of the password used for 
# login when your YubiKey / NitroKey3 is present.
# You don't have to provide a password; if this file is left as is then 
# authentication with your dongle won't require an additional password
#
# To generate a SHA1 hash, you can use this command (replace "PASSWORD" with
# your actual password):
#
#    echo -n "PASSWORD" | openssl dgst -sha1
#
# If you add your password hash in this file, then the plaintext version 
# in the `login-pass` file will be ignored.
